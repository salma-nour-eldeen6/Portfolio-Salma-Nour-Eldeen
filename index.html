                       <h3>First Week</h3>
<p>
    During the first week of training in the IT department, I gained a deeper understanding of several key concepts. It was great to be in a work environment and see many things that I had only read about on paper. I received an introductory tour of the IT department and learned several things in my first week, including:
</p>

<h4>1. Active Directory (AD)</h4>
<p>
    I learned how to use Active Directory to manage users and devices within a network.
</p>

<h4>2. Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)</h4>
<p>
    I studied how DHCP automatically assigns IP addresses to devices on the network, and learned about key concepts such as:
    <ul>
        <li>IP addresses</li>
        <li>Gateways</li>
        <li>Domain Name System (DNS)</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<h4>3. Windows Server Update Services (WSUS)</h4>
<p>
    I learned about the importance of WSUS in managing software updates on devices.
</p>

<h4>4. Redundant Array of Independent Disks (RAID)</h4>
<p>
    I gained knowledge about how RAID technologies are used to enhance performance and increase data storage security.
